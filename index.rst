An introduction to Python and LaTeX
========================================
The  BSc Informatics course conducted by `University of Calicut <http://http://www.universityofcalicut.info>`_ is based completely on Free  Software. Students are required to study the Python programming language and also learn how to
prepare technical documents using LaTeX. A   majority of the students have a computing background 
limited to using Microsoft Windows for simple tasks like web browsing. 
*An introduction to Python and LaTeX* has
the objective of providing a gentle introduction to computing to such an audience. 

Because most of the readers
would be either Mathematics teachers or undergraduate Math students, sample programs are structured around
simple mathematical concepts. No attempt has been made to go deep into language syntax - my experience  with conducting several
workshops for teachers has been that any attempt to introduce syntax elements whose application can't be demonstrated immediately
through simple math examples usually leads to confusion. So, this book will not be an ideal resource for people who wish
to master Python syntax and idioms in depth. There are plenty of great resources on the net for that, one of the best being
*Dive into Python* (available at  http://www.diveintopython.org).
